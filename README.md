# New Leaf Bank

## What is this?

New Leaf Bank is a companion app for true Animal Crossing players created to help manage their bells in a smarter way. NLB lets you create separate bank accounts (as the game lacks this feature), allowing you to set an income share for each account. This way, each account will receive only the % you set to it from every income you deposit to the bank.

## Features

- Create/Edit/Delete Account
- Drag and Drop Account Management
- Set an Income Share
